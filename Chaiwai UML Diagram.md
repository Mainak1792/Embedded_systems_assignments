# UML Diagrams For Tea Ordering And Delivery System

### Brief Description : 
UML Diagrams depict a system from various perspectives. This assignment covers the depiction of CHAIWAI Service System via UML Diagrams that model the behaviour and the structure of the system. 

* The System involves Three actors, The customer, the outlets and the delivery person.
* The Chaiwai system acts as a mediary between the three to carry out the goals of the system, taking orders and delivering tea. 
* Various corner cases have been covered such as breakdown of delivery boy's vehicle, Delay in payment due to temperature of tea being lesser than promised. 
* The Behavioural diagrams include Sequence, Timing, Activity, State Machine Diagrams. These are as given below -
